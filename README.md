### Introduction
In this project, I did the analysis for Stack Overflow Survey Data from 2017. My goal was to find out what we need to consider when hiring programmers by looking at their annual salaries.

There are many factors to consider, but I looked at the following:
- Question 1: Can I hire people without a Computer Science education?
- Question 2: Should open-source contribution be a requirement?
- Question 3: Tabs or Spaces?

### Result Summary
After I did the analysis, these are the conclusion I found:
1. Education seems to be a poor indicator of job performance
2. Open-Source contributions and Tabs vs Spaces seems to be a good indicator if performance
3. In programming there are many less obvious factors that are more important than the ones that most reqruiters look at
